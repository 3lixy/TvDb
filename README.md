PhpTvDb
=======

Based on the well known php library phptvdb (available on http://code.google.com/p/phptvdb/), this version
will try offer more features from the tvdb api (available on http://www.thetvdb.com/wiki/index.php/Programmers_API)
by using PHP 5.3 namespaces, very useful to import in a bigger project like Symfony 2 for example.

This version still needs a lot of refactoring and should not be used as this.
